If you have too many variables, some of which are  correlated or collinear, you may need to do variable selection *(techniques for variable selection that you will learn later in the course - stepwise regression, lasso, ridge regression)*. If the variables do not have a linear relationship with the response, or if some of the modeling assumptions are not satisfied, you may need to transform the predictors and/or the response (variable transformation) to obtain a better fit.\n",

    "We are interested in understanding how various factors may influence the price of diamonds. This problem is a regression problem because our response of interest is a quantitative variable (price), as well as an inference problem since we want to understand the relationship between the predictors and the response. Inference will help sellers/jewelers determine the most important factors that need to be taken into account when they try to fetch the highest possible price on diamonds they make and sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will optimize RMSE because we want to penalize larger errors in diamond cost. Not all errors are weighed equally; As a jeweler it would be worse to undersell diamonds by a large margin because you would lose more money. From the buyer’s point of view, it would be worse to overpay by a large margin as well on diamonds that are extremely overpriced compared to the intrinsic value the model predicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suspect there might be a multicollinearity problem for the predictors since the dataset includes length, width, depth, and total depth percentage which is a formula that takes into account length, width, and depth values. VIF will help with determining multicollinearity for variable selection if necessary, though there do not seem to be many (logically) irrelevant variables. We also do not know if diamond price’s relationship with other variables is linear, so we may have to do variable transformation as well. "
