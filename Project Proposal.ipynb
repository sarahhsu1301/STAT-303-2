If you have too many variables, some of which are  correlated or collinear, you may need to do variable selection *(techniques for variable selection that you will learn later in the course - stepwise regression, lasso, ridge regression)*. If the variables do not have a linear relationship with the response, or if some of the modeling assumptions are not satisfied, you may need to transform the predictors and/or the response (variable transformation) to obtain a better fit.\n",

This problem is a regression problem because our response of interest is a quantitative variable (net income), as well as an inference problem since we want to understand the relationship between the predictors and the response. Inference will help both companies and investors understand the most fundamental metrics to look for when choosing a stock to invest in.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will optimize RMSE because we want to penalize larger errors in predicting net incomes for companies. Not all errors are weighed equally; as an investor or shareholder in a company you wouldn’t want to see a large error in predicting net income because that will directly impact your projected returns. Large errors might also throw off companies and overestimate their financial performance on the year, leading to erroneous business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to determine whether the model follows assumptions such as linearity and constant error variance. Variable transformation may also be necessary for several predictors.\n",
    "Furthermore, VIF will help with determining multicollinearity for variable selection, especially as the dataset contains 71 columns of variables that may be correlated with several others. We may also need to identify outliers and high leverage points if they exist and determine if they are influential; to do so, we would use metrics like Cook’s distance. "
